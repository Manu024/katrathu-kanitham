            4.	Represent each of the given relations by (a) an arrow diagram, (b) a graph and (c) a set in roster form, wherever possible.
(i)	{(x,y)|x = 2y, x ∈{2,3,4,5}, y ∈{1,2,3,4}
(ii) {(x,y)|y = x+3, x, y are natural numbers < 10}

            5.	A company has four categories of employees given by Assistants (A), Clerks (C), Managers  (M)  and  an  Executive  Officer (E).  The  company  provide ₹10,000,
₹25,000, ₹50,000 and ₹1,00,000 as salaries to the people who work in the categories A, C, M and E respectively. If A1, A2, A3, A4  and A5  were Assistants; C1, C2, C3, C4 were Clerks; M1, M2, M3 were managers and E1, E2 were Executive officers and if the relation R is defined by xRy, where x is the salary given to person y, express the relation R through an ordered pair and an arrow diagram.
